            <p>I would like to grow my Java skillset and I think this is a great resource to do it. I just started taking a look here and would like to continue going through these lessons even the simple intro level had something to offer to my base knowledge of Java.</p>

            <p>I would like to get more practice with technical questions and problem solving skills. Here's a link of a <a href="https://inspirit.net.in/books/placements/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview.pdf"><strong>book</strong></a> I started reading.</p>

        <h3><strong>Topic to Improve:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li><h4><strong>Java:</strong> </h4><strong>I would like to get more practice working in Java. I do not feel strong enough in Java.</strong></li>
          <li><h4><strong>Interview Questions: </strong></h4><strong>I would like to get more practice with whiteboarding, and geared questions.</strong></li>
          <li><h4><strong>Refactor Projects: </strong></h4> <strong>I would like to go back and either rebuild projects or refactor projects in different ways to demonstrate a futher understanding of applying concepts we have learned. </strong></li>
          <li><h4><strong>Cover Letter:</strong> (Non-technical)</h4> <strong> I would like to create a cover letter template that i can utilize for different positions that I apply for. I do not have one now and need to work on formulating one. I spent time today reading through some cover letter templates: <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/cover-letter-template-2060213">Cover Letter Template Article</a>

        <h3><strong>Priorities: </strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li><h4><strong>Hack Reactor Problems</strong></h4>
          <p>I will start solving at least one problem a day after class to keep my skillset up and to learn more about algorithms that serve both programming skills and interview questions.</p></li>
          <li><h4><strong>Cover Letter: </strong></h4>
            <p>I plan on working on a cover letter and having it completed within the next two weeks.</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4><strong>Java Courses: </strong></h4>
          <p>I will commit to weekly courses of Java to strengthen my knowledge of Java as an object oriented programming language.</p></li>
